If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

The audio aura of songs are determined by several factors including their danceability, energy, valence and tempo.
The 100 songs all have their own ratings which can help determine the genre of the songs the listener enjoys listening to.
For example, high-tempo songs indicate faster-paced and more energetic music, while low-tempo songs imply more peaceful, relaxed music.
It should be noted that artists tend to follow specific themes based on the era, lyrical trends, and musical motifs.
With these in mind, the mood and genre of the 100 songs can be determined, which in turn will characterize the listener's audio aura.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

If we were to solely use factors such as danceability, tempo, and energy to describe audio aura, it is easy to miss out on key factors like the overall mood, lyrics and hidden themes behind the music which can influence the listener to enjoy specific types of music.
It is quite difficult to describe an audio aura with only quantitative measures -- it would be a lot more effective to evaluate this QUALITATIVELY as well.
Some qualitative methods for evaluating listeners' preferred type of music may include conducting surveys and self-report questionnaires to identify listeners' physiological and psychological responses to certain types of music, which in turn will help characterize their audio aura more definitely.
It would also be helpful to use established theories like Weber's Law to evaluate the listeners' levels of stimulation to music and minimize potential biases.
